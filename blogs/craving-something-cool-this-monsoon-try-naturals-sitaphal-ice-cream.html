          hai – the fruit of patience is sweet. And indeed, after eagerly
          waiting through the year, the sweet reward has finally arrived.
          Naturals Ice Cream’s Sitaphal Ice Cream (sitaphal meaning custard
          apple) is back in the freezers across all Naturals outlets, just in
          time to brighten up the monsoon blues. If the rainy season has you
          craving something indulgent and oh-so-cool, this seasonal ice cream is
          here to sweeten those grey, drizzly days.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p class="text-muted">
          Imagine raindrops tapping on your window, a cosy evening at home, and
          in your hand, a cup of decadent Sitaphal Ice Cream. One bite and
          you’re greeted with the lush, grainy texture of real custard apple
          pulp, a flavour that’s both refreshing and comforting on a damp day.
          Monsoon showers bring a refreshing coolness to the air, and pairing it
          with the cool, sweet scoop of Naturals’ custard apple ice cream is
          beautifully gratifying. It’s an experience that somehow fits perfectly
          with the rhythm of falling rain, soothing your senses with every
          spoonful.
        </p>

          <h3>A monsoon must-have delight</h3>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            Just when the beloved summer Alphonso mangoes bid us farewell,
            Naturals swoops in with the season’s next star – Sitaphal ice cream
            – to delight our taste buds. Custard apple is a monsoon fruit,
            cherished for its creamy, grainy texture and fragrant sweetness.
            Besides, there’s something incredibly sumptuous about digging in a
            scoop of sitaphal as you listen to the pitter-patter outside. It’s
            like a sweet hug in a bowl, both soothing and satisfying to the
            soul. No wonder this flavour is on everyone’s monsoon to-eat list!
          </p>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            It starts with farm-fresh fruit. The custard apples that go into
            each batch are handpicked from the renowned Saswad region of
            Maharashtra, a place famous for high-quality sitaphal cultivation.
            These plump, green, bumpy fruits are bursting with inherent
            sweetness, and Naturals ensures only the ripest, tastiest ones make
            the cut. As a result, every scoop of this ice cream carries a burst
            of fruit flavour in every bite.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>Real ingredients, real flavour</h3>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            True to its name, Naturals keeps everything simple. Each batch of
            Sitaphal ice cream is prepared from just three primary
            ingredients:milk, sugar, and luscious sitaphals. That’s it! In fact,
            you’ll notice the difference from the very first spoonful: it tastes
            exactly like the fruit because it is the fruit, only colder and
            creamier. Naturals has a long-standing commitment to using
            unprocessed ingredients, so you can indulge guilt-free knowing your
            ice cream is really authentic. It’s a genuine tree to treat
            experience – from the orchards of Saswad to your cup, cone or bowl.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            And oh, that texture! If you’ve ever eaten a custard apple, you know
            it’s a bit of a task with all those black seeds in each segment of
            flesh. Naturals has taken care of that little problem in the most
            innovative way. Fun fact: Mr. Raghunandan Srinivas Kamath, Natural’s
            founder, invented a special Sitaphal de-seeding machine to do the
            hard work of separating the custard apple seeds from the pulp. This
            custom machine – a brainchild of the founder of Naturals Ice Cream –
            makes it possible to process tons of the delicate sitaphal fruit
            efficiently. What used to be an intense manual labour of love
            (imagine deseeding thousands of custard apples by hand for each
            batch!) is now done with mechanical precision. The result? Every
            scoop is silky-smooth and seed-free, yet still filled with the
            grainy bits of real custard apples that make the experience
            delightful. It’s like enjoying the fruit without the hassle,
            delivered with plenty of love and innovation. No wonder Naturals
            calls it a true ‘labour of love’ – they go to great lengths to
            ensure we get to enjoy this flavour in its purest form.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h3>A scoop for every mood (and everyone!)</h3>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            One of the best things about Naturals Sitaphal Ice Cream is its
            universal appeal. Whether you’re a kid excitedly discovering this
            unique flavour for the first time, or an adult reminiscing about the
            sitaphal from your childhood, this ice cream has a way of bringing
            joy to all ages. It’s sweet but not too sweet, creamy yet
            refreshingly fruity, striking that perfect balance that makes you
            want to keep digging in. In short, it’s an ice cream everyone in the
            family can bond over.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            Naturals also gives you plenty of ways to enjoy this seasonal
            delight. Of course, you can always walk into a Naturals outlet and
            relish a single scoop or double scoop in a cup or cone, letting the
            cool creamy goodness uplift your rainy day mood. But why stop there?
            If you’re in the mood to experiment, try a Sitaphal Milkshake –
            blend a few scoops with a splash of milk and you’ve got yourself a
            thick, heavenly milkshake that pairs perfectly with watching the
            rain by the window. For those who prefer to dig in at home under a
            warm blanket, Naturals offers convenient take-home packs online and
            in-stores. Grab a Mini Pack (300 g) for a solo treat, or a Family
            Pack (500 g) to share the love with everyone at home. The
            possibilities are endless.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h3>Monsoon magic – limited time only!</h3>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            Like the monsoon rains, this special flavour doesn’t last forever.
            Naturals Sitaphal Ice Cream is a seasonal affair, available only for
            a limited period each year. Typically, it makes its grand return as
            the first showers of monsoon hit, and it sticks around just about
            until winter chills set in, roughly 183 days of sitaphal bliss
            before it goes back into hibernation until the next monsoon. What
            does that mean for you? It means now is the time to relish it! Don’t
            procrastinate on this one, because once it’s gone, you’ll have to
            exercise that patience again until next year (sigh).
          </p>

          <br />
          <p class="text-muted">
            Head over to your nearest Naturals Ice Cream outlet (or even order
            online, snuggled on your couch) and treat yourself to the original
            sitaphal ice cream that everyone raves about. Enjoy the rain, enjoy
            the ice cream, and remember, sabr ka phal indeed meetha hota hai
            especially when that phal is a scoop of Naturals Sitaphal Ice Cream.
